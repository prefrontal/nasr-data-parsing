  GENERAL INFORMATION:
  ===================

    THIS FILE CONTAINS BOTH STAR AND SID DATA. ALL STARS ARE
    PRESENTED FIRST, FOLLOWED BY SID DATA. USERS MUST DETECT A
    CHANGE IN THE FIRST CHARACTER OF A RECORD FROM 'S' TO 'D'
    TO KNOW WHEN TO BEGIN SID RECORD FORMAT PROCESSING.

STANDARD TERMINAL ARRIVAL FILE
                     ==============================

FILE STRUCTURE DESCRIPTION:
---------------------------

    THERE ARE A VARIABLE NUMBER OF FIXED-LENGTH RECORDS FOR EACH
    STANDARD TERMINAL ARRIVAL (STAR). EACH GROUP OF RECORDS FOR
    A STAR IS ASSIGNED A 5 CHARACTER INTERNAL SEQUENCE NUMBER.
    A STAR RECORD GROUP BEGINS WITH A POINT-TO-POINT DESCRIPTION
    OF THE BASIC STAR FOLLOWED BY INDIVIDUAL RECORDS FOR EACH
    AIRPORT ADAPTED FOR USE OF THE STAR. ADAPTED AIRPORTS ARE
    FOLLOWED BY GROUPS OF RECORDS REPRESENTING
    A POINT-TO-POINT DESCRIPTION OF EACH TRANSITION FROM THE
    ENROUTE AIRSPACE SYSTEM TO THE BASIC STAR.

    THE FILE IS SORTED BY STAR NAME. THIS FILE INCLUDES ONLY THOSE
    STARS THAT HAVE AN ASSIGNED COMPUTER CODE. MULTIPLE MAIN
    BODY STARS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE FILE.

    THE SEQUENCE OF RECORDS TO DESCRIBE A STAR ARE SUMMARIZED
    AS FOLLOWS:

      - FIRST RECORD OF THE BASIC STAR: IDENTIFIED BY A CHANGE
        IN THE INTERNAL SEQUENCE NUMBER (E.G. S0010). IF THE ARRIVAL
        IS DIRECT FROM THE ENROUTE AIRSPACE SYSTEM TO THE
        TRANSITION FIX/NAVAID, THE FIRST RECORD SHALL CONTAIN THE
        INITIAL FIX/NAVAID ON A PATH FROM THE ENROUTE SYSTEM TO
        THE TRANSITION FIX/NAVAID.  OTHERWISE, (I.E. THERE ARE
        MULTIPLE PATHS FROM THE ENROUTE SYSTEM TO THE TRANSITION
        FIX/NAVAID), THE FIRST RECORD SHALL CONTAIN THE TRANSITION
        FIX/NAVAID IDENTIFIER AND ITS POSITIONAL INFORMATION.  IN
        EITHER CASE, THE FIRST RECORD WILL CONTAIN THE COMPUTER CODE
        AND NAME OF THE BASIC STAR.

      - THE FIRST RECORD OF THE BASIC STAR IS FOLLOWED BY A
        VARIABLE NUMBER OF RECORDS THAT DESCRIBE A PATH,
        IN POINT-TO-POINT ORDER, FROM THE ENROUTE AIRSPACE SYSTEM
        TO THE TRANSITION FIX/NAVAID. FOR STARS WITH A SINGLE
        TRANSITION PATH, THE FINAL RECORD OF THE BASIC STAR
        WILL CONTAIN THE TRANSITION FIX/NAVAID IDENTIFIER.

      - FOLLOWING THE DESCRIPTION OF THE BASIC STAR ARE
        ONE OR MORE RECORDS DESCRIBING ALL AIRPORTS USING
        THIS STAR. THE FIX/FACILITY TYPE CODE FIELD WILL CONTAIN
        AN 'AA'.

      - RECORD GROUPS DESCRIBING ANY TRANSITIONS FROM
        THE ENROUTE AIRSPACE SYSTEM TO THE TRANSITION FIX/NAVAID.
        THE RECORD GROUP BEGINS WITH A RECORD FOR THE TRANSITION
        FIX/NAVAID THAT WILL INCLUDE THE COMPUTER CODE AND
        NAME OF THE TRANSITION.

      - SUBSEQUENT RECORDS WITHIN A GROUP FOR A TRANSITION PROVIDE
        A POINT-TO-POINT DESCRIPTION FROM THE ENROUTE AIRSPACE
        SYSTEM TO THE TRANSITION FIX/NAVAID.

      - THERE MAY BE MULTIPLE TRANSITION GROUPS FOR A STAR. THEY
        WILL MAINTAIN THE SAME INTERNAL SEQUENCE NUMBER. PRESENCE
        OF DATA IN THE COMPUTER CODE FIELD SIGNALS THE BEGINNING OF
        A TRANSITION RECORD GROUP.

      - DESCRIPTION OF A STAR IS COMPLETE WHEN A RECORD IS READ
        THAT CONTAINS A DIFFERENT INTERNAL SEQUENCE NUMBER (I.E.
        THE FIRST RECORD OF THE NEXT STAR).

                   ==================================

FILE STRUCTURE DESCRIPTION:
---------------------------

    THERE ARE A VARIABLE NUMBER OF FIXED-LENGTH RECORDS FOR EACH
    STANDARD INSTRUMENT DEPARTURE (SID). EACH GROUP OF RECORDS FOR
    A SID IS ASSIGNED A 5 CHARACTER INTERNAL SEQUENCE NUMBER.
    A SID RECORD GROUP BEGINS WITH A POINT-TO-POINT DESCRIPTION
    OF THE BASIC SID FOLLOWED BY INDIVIDUAL RECORDS FOR EACH
    AIRPORT ADAPTED FOR USE OF THE SID. ADAPTED AIRPORTS ARE
    FOLLOWED BY GROUPS OF RECORDS REPRESENTING
    A POINT-TO-POINT DESCRIPTION OF EACH TRANSITION
    FROM THE BASIC SID TO THE ENROUTE AIRSPACE SYSTEM.

    THE FILE IS SORTED BY SID NAME THEN TRANSITION NAMES
    WITHIN THE SID RECORD GROUP. THIS FILE INCLUDES ONLY THOSE
    SIDS THAT HAVE AN ASSIGNED COMPUTER CODE. MULTIPLE MAIN
    BODY SIDS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE FILE.

    THE SEQUENCE OF RECORDS TO DESCRIBE A SID ARE SUMMARIZED
    AS FOLLOWS:

      - FIRST RECORD OF THE BASIC SID: IDENTIFIED BY A CHANGE
        IN THE INTERNAL SEQUENCE NUMBER (E.G. D0040). IF THE
        DEPARTURE IS DIRECTLY TO THE TRANSITION FIX, THE FIX/NAVAID
        IDENTIFIER FIELD WILL BE THE TRANSITION FIX; OTHERWISE,
        THE FIX/NAVAID WILL BE THE FIRST POINT ON A PATH TO
        THE TRANSITION FIX/NAVAID.  THIS RECORD WILL CONTAIN
        THE COMPUTER CODE AND NAME OF THE BASIC SID.

      - IF THE DEPARTURE IS NOT DIRECTLY TO THE TRANSITION FIX,
        THERE WILL BE A VARIABLE NUMBER OF RECORDS THAT DESCRIBE
        A PATH, IN POINT-TO-POINT ORDER, FROM THE DEPARTURE
        FACILITY TO THE TRANSITION FIX. THE FINAL RECORD IN THIS
        GROUP WILL BE THE TRANSITION FIX.

      - FOLLOWING THE DESCRIPTION OF THE BASIC SID ARE
        ONE OR MORE RECORDS DESCRIBING ALL AIRPORTS USING
        THIS SID. THE FIX/FACILITY TYPE CODE FIELD WILL
        CONTAIN AN 'AA'.

      - IF THERE ARE AIRPORTS SERVED BY THE DP THAT ARE NOT SERVED
	BY THE BODY (OR IF THERE IS NO MAIN BODY), THERE WILL BE
	ONE OR MORE RECORDS DESCRIBING THESE AIRPORTS, WITH THE
	FIX/FACILITY TYPE CODE FIELD CONTAINING AN 'NA'. THE FIRST
	OF THESE RECORDS WILL CONTAIN THE COMPUTER CODE AND NAME OF
	THE BASIC DP.

      - RECORD GROUPS DESCRIBING ANY TRANSITIONS FROM
        THE TRANSITION FIX TO THE ENROUTE AIRSPACE SYSTEM.
        THE RECORD GROUP BEGINS WITH A RECORD FOR THE TRANSITION
        FIX THAT WILL INCLUDE THE COMPUTER CODE AND NAME OF THE
        TRANSITION.

      - SUBSEQUENT RECORDS WITHIN A GROUP FOR A TRANSITION PROVIDE
        A POINT TO POINT DESCRIPTION FROM THE TRANSITION FIX
        TO THE ENROUTE AIRSPACE SYSTEM.

      - THERE MAY BE MULTIPLE TRANSITION GROUPS FOR A SID. THEY
        WILL MAINTAIN THE SAME INTERNAL SEQUENCE NUMBER. PRESENCE
        OF DATA IN THE COMPUTER CODE FIELD SIGNALS THE BEGINNING OF
        A TRANSITION RECORD GROUP.

      - DESCRIPTION OF A SID IS COMPLETE WHEN A RECORD IS READ
        THAT CONTAINS A DIFFERENT INTERNAL SEQUENCE NUMBER (I.E.
        THE FIRST RECORD OF THE NEXT SID).
