                            ADVANCED NAV ROUTE
                        DATA BASE RECORD LAYOUT
                              (ANR-FILE)

INFORMATION EFFECTIVE DATE: 02/06/2014

    RECORD FORMAT: FIXED
    LOGICAL RECORD LENGTH: 264



FILE STRUCTURE DESCRIPTION:
---------------------------

    THERE ARE A VARIABLE NUMBER OF FIXED-LENGTH RECORDS FOR
    EACH ADVANCED NAV ROUTE (ANR).  THE NUMBER OF RECORDS IS
    DETERMINED BY THE NUMBER OF SEGMENTS USED TO DESCRIBE THE
    ROUTE. THE DIFFERENT RECORD TYPES WILL BE IDENTIFIABLE BY A
    RECORD TYPE INDICATOR (ANR1 OR ANR2) AND THE ROUTE KEY
    (ORIGIN IDENT, DESTINATION IDENT, AND ROUTE TYPE CODE). BECAUSE
    THERE CAN BE MORE THAN ONE ADVANCED NAV ROUTE BETWEEN TWO LOCATIONS,
    A SEQUENCE NUMBER IS INCLUDED IN THE ROUTE KEY TO INSURE
    THAT A UNIQUE ROUTE KEY IS PRESENT. THE ROUTE SEGMENT
    RECORDS ARE ALSO ORDERED BY A SEQUENCE NUMBER. THE FILE IS
    SORTED BY ROUTE KEY, RECORD TYPE, AND SEGMENT SEQUENCE NUMBER.

    EACH RECORD ENDS WITH A CARRIAGE RETURN CHARACTER AND LINE FEED
    CHARACTER (CR/LF). THIS LINE TERMINATOR IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE
    LOGICAL RECORD LENGTH.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD TYPES:
--------------------------------

    'ANR1' RECORD TYPE CONTAINS THE BASE ADVANCED NAV ROUTE DATA.
    IT CONTAINS DESCRIPTIVE INFORMATION THAT IS APPLICABLE TO THE
    ENTIRE ROUTE. THERE IS ALWAYS A ANR1 RECORD.

    'ANR2' RECORD TYPE CONTAINS DATA TO DESCRIBE ONE SEGMENT ALONG
    THE ROUTE. IT IDENTIFIES THE SEGMENT TYPE (AIRWAY, NAVAID,
    FIX, ETC.) AND PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO DESCRIBE
    THE SEGMENT, DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF SEGMENT. THERE CAN BE
    ANY NUMBER OF ANR2 RECORDS (INCLUDING NONE AT ALL).


GENERAL INFORMATION:
--------------------
     1.  LEFT JUSTIFIED FIELDS HAVE TRAILING BLANKS
     2.  RIGHT JUSTIFIED FIELDS HAVE LEADING BLANKS
     3.  ELEMENT NUMBER IS FOR INTERNAL REFERENCE ONLY
         AND NOT IN RECORD
     4.  THE ANR ROUTE UNIQUE KEY (ELEMENT NUMBER:DLID) IS MADE UP OF THE
         ORIGIN IDENT, DESTINATION IDENT, ROUTE TYPE, AND A SEQUENCE NUMBER
         TO DISTINGUISH MULTIPLE ROUTES BETWEEN TWO POINTS.
