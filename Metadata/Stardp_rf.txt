  GENERAL INFORMATION:
  ===================

    THIS FILE CONTAINS BOTH STANDARD TERMINAL ARRIVAL (STAR) AND
    STANDARD DEPARTURE PROCEDURE (DP) DATA. ALL STARS ARE
    PRESENTED FIRST, FOLLOWED BY DP DATA. USERS MUST DETECT A
    CHANGE IN THE FIRST CHARACTER OF A RECORD FROM 'S' TO 'D'
    TO KNOW WHEN TO BEGIN DP RECORD FORMAT PROCESSING.

    THIS FILE IS DIFFERENT FROM THE SSD SUBSCRIBER FILE IN THAT
    IT CONTAINS A COMPLETE COMPREHENSIVE SET OF STAR AND DP
    PROCEDURES, INCLUDING MULTIPLE MAIN BODY AND PROCEDURES WITHOUT
    COMPUTER IDS.

                     STANDARD TERMINAL ARRIVAL FILE
                     ==============================

FILE STRUCTURE DESCRIPTION:
---------------------------

    THERE ARE A VARIABLE NUMBER OF FIXED-LENGTH RECORDS FOR EACH
    STANDARD TERMINAL ARRIVAL (STAR). EACH GROUP OF RECORDS FOR
    A STAR IS ASSIGNED A 5 CHARACTER INTERNAL SEQUENCE NUMBER.
    A STAR RECORD GROUP BEGINS WITH A POINT-TO-POINT DESCRIPTION
    OF THE BASIC STAR BODIES FOLLOWED BY INDIVIDUAL RECORDS FOR EACH
    AIRPORT ADAPTED FOR USE OF THE STAR. ADAPTED AIRPORTS ARE
    FOLLOWED BY GROUPS OF RECORDS REPRESENTING
    A POINT-TO-POINT DESCRIPTION OF EACH TRANSITION FROM THE
    ENROUTE AIRSPACE SYSTEM TO THE BASIC STAR.

    THE FILE IS SORTED BY STAR NAME. THIS FILE INCLUDES STARS THAT
    DO NOT HAVE AN ASSIGNED COMPUTER CODE. MULTIPLE MAIN BODY STARS
    ARE INCLUDED IN THE FILE.

    THE SEQUENCE OF RECORDS TO DESCRIBE A STAR ARE SUMMARIZED
    AS FOLLOWS:

      - FIRST RECORD OF THE BASIC STAR: IDENTIFIED BY A CHANGE
        IN THE INTERNAL SEQUENCE NUMBER (E.G. S0010). IF THE ARRIVAL
        IS DIRECT FROM THE ENROUTE AIRSPACE SYSTEM TO THE
        TRANSITION FIX/NAVAID, THE FIRST RECORD SHALL CONTAIN THE
        INITIAL FIX/NAVAID ON A PATH FROM THE ENROUTE SYSTEM TO
        THE TRANSITION FIX/NAVAID.  OTHERWISE, (I.E. THERE ARE
        MULTIPLE PATHS FROM THE ENROUTE SYSTEM TO THE TRANSITION
        FIX/NAVAID), THE FIRST RECORD SHALL CONTAIN THE TRANSITION
        FIX/NAVAID IDENTIFIER AND ITS POSITIONAL INFORMATION.  IN
        EITHER CASE, THE FIRST RECORD WILL CONTAIN THE COMPUTER CODE
        AND NAME OF THE BASIC STAR.

      - THE FIRST RECORD OF THE BASIC STAR IS FOLLOWED BY A
        VARIABLE NUMBER OF RECORDS THAT DESCRIBE A PATH,
        IN POINT-TO-POINT ORDER, FROM THE ENROUTE AIRSPACE SYSTEM
        TO THE TRANSITION FIX/NAVAID. FOR STARS WITH A SINGLE
        TRANSITION PATH, THE FINAL RECORD OF THE BASIC STAR
        WILL CONTAIN THE TRANSITION FIX/NAVAID IDENTIFIER.

      - FOLLOWING THE DESCRIPTION OF THE BASIC STAR ARE
        ONE OR MORE RECORDS DESCRIBING ALL AIRPORTS USING
        THIS STAR. THE FIX/FACILITY TYPE CODE FIELD WILL CONTAIN
        AN 'AA'.

      - FOR STARS WITH MULTIPLE MAIN BODIES, THE ABOVE SEQUENCE
        WILL BE REPEATED FOR EACH BODY. I.E., THE FIRST RECORD OF THE
        STAR (CONTAINING THE STAR COMPUTER CODE AND STAR NAME) WILL
        BE FOLLOWED BY A VARIABLE NUMBER OF RECORDS THAT
        DESCRIBE A PATH IN POINT-TO-POINT ORDER. FOLLOWING THE
        DESCRIPTION OF EACH BASIC STAR BODY ARE ONE OR MORE
        RECORDS DESCRIBING ALL AIRPORTS USING THIS STAR. THE
        FIX/FACILITY TYPE CODE FIELD WILL CONTAIN AN 'AA'.

      - NEXT ARE RECORD GROUPS DESCRIBING ANY TRANSITIONS FROM
        THE ENROUTE AIRSPACE SYSTEM TO THE TRANSITION FIX/NAVAID.
        THE RECORD GROUP BEGINS WITH A RECORD FOR THE TRANSITION
        FIX/NAVAID THAT WILL INCLUDE THE COMPUTER CODE AND
        NAME OF THE TRANSITION.

      - SUBSEQUENT RECORDS WITHIN A GROUP FOR A TRANSITION PROVIDE
        A POINT-TO-POINT DESCRIPTION FROM THE ENROUTE AIRSPACE
        SYSTEM TO THE TRANSITION FIX/NAVAID.

      - THERE MAY BE MULTIPLE TRANSITION GROUPS FOR A STAR. THEY
        WILL MAINTAIN THE SAME INTERNAL SEQUENCE NUMBER. PRESENCE
        OF DATA IN THE COMPUTER CODE FIELD SIGNALS THE BEGINNING OF
        A TRANSITION RECORD GROUP.

      - DESCRIPTION OF A STAR IS COMPLETE WHEN A RECORD IS READ
        THAT CONTAINS A DIFFERENT INTERNAL SEQUENCE NUMBER (I.E.
        THE FIRST RECORD OF THE NEXT STAR).

                   ============================================

FILE STRUCTURE DESCRIPTION:
---------------------------

    THERE ARE A VARIABLE NUMBER OF FIXED-LENGTH RECORDS FOR EACH
    STANDARD INSTRUMENT DEPARTURE PROCEDURE (DP). EACH GROUP OF
    RECORDS FOR A DP IS ASSIGNED A 5 CHARACTER INTERNAL SEQUENCE
    NUMBER. A DP RECORD GROUP BEGINS WITH A POINT-TO-POINT
    DESCRIPTION OF THE BASIC DP FOLLOWED BY INDIVIDUAL RECORDS FOR
    EACH AIRPORT ADAPTED FOR USE OF THE DP. ADAPTED AIRPORTS ARE
    FOLLOWED BY GROUPS OF RECORDS REPRESENTING
    A POINT-TO-POINT DESCRIPTION OF EACH TRANSITION
    FROM THE BASIC DP TO THE ENROUTE AIRSPACE SYSTEM.

    THE FILE IS SORTED BY DP NAME THEN TRANSITION NAMES
    WITHIN THE DP RECORD GROUP. THIS FILE INCLUDES DPS THAT DO NOT
    HAVE AN ASSIGNED COMPUTER CODE. MULTIPLE MAIN
    BODY DPS ARE INCLUDED IN THE FILE.

    THE SEQUENCE OF RECORDS TO DESCRIBE A DP ARE SUMMARIZED
    AS FOLLOWS:

      - FIRST RECORD OF THE BASIC DP: IDENTIFIED BY A CHANGE
        IN THE INTERNAL SEQUENCE NUMBER (E.G. D0040). IF THE
        DEPARTURE IS DIRECTLY TO THE TRANSITION FIX, THE FIX/NAVAID
        IDENTIFIER FIELD WILL BE THE TRANSITION FIX; OTHERWISE,
        THE FIX/NAVAID WILL BE THE FIRST POINT ON A PATH TO
        THE TRANSITION FIX/NAVAID.  THIS RECORD WILL CONTAIN
        THE COMPUTER CODE AND NAME OF THE BASIC DP.

      - IF THE DEPARTURE IS NOT DIRECTLY TO THE TRANSITION FIX,
        THERE WILL BE A VARIABLE NUMBER OF RECORDS THAT DESCRIBE
        A PATH, IN POINT-TO-POINT ORDER, FROM THE DEPARTURE
        FACILITY TO THE TRANSITION FIX. THE FINAL RECORD IN THIS
        GROUP WILL BE THE TRANSITION FIX.

      - FOLLOWING THE DESCRIPTION OF THE BASIC DP ARE
        ONE OR MORE RECORDS DESCRIBING ALL AIRPORTS USING
        THIS DP. THE FIX/FACILITY TYPE CODE FIELD WILL
        CONTAIN AN 'AA'.

      - IF THERE ARE MULTIPLE MAIN BODIES TO THE BASIC DP, EACH
        PATH WILL BE DESCRIBED FOLLOWING THE ABOVE AIRPORTS RECORDS.
        EACH PATH WILL CONTAIN A VARIABLE NUMBER OR RECORDS, IN
        POINT TO POINT ORDER, FROM THE DEPARTURE FACILITY TO THE
        TRANSITION FIX. THE FINAL RECORD IN EACH PATH WILL BE THE
        TRANSITION FIX.  FOLLOWING THE DESCRIPTION OF EACH BODY ARE
	ONE OR MORE RECORDS DESCRIBING ALL AIRPORTS SERVED BY THE
	BODY.

      - IF THERE ARE AIRPORTS SERVED BY THE DP THAT ARE NOT SERVED
	BY ANY BODY, THERE WILL BE ONE ONE OR MORE RECORDS DESCRIBING
	THESE AIRPORTS, WITH THE FIX/FACILITY TYPE CODE FIELD
	CONTAINING AN 'NA'. THE FIRST OF THESE RECORDS WILL CONTAIN
	THE COMPUTER CODE AND NAME OF THE BASIC DP.  THESE RECORDS
	WILL BE THE FIRST RECORDS FOR THE DP IF THERE ARE NO BODIES
	FOR THE DP, AND WILL FOLLOW THE LAST BODY DESCRIPTION IF
	THERE ARE ANY BODIES.

      - NEXT ARE RECORD GROUPS DESCRIBING ANY TRANSITIONS FROM
        THE TRANSITION FIX TO THE ENROUTE AIRSPACE SYSTEM.
        THE RECORD GROUP BEGINS WITH A RECORD FOR THE TRANSITION
        FIX THAT WILL INCLUDE THE COMPUTER CODE AND NAME OF THE
        TRANSITION.

      - SUBSEQUENT RECORDS WITHIN A GROUP FOR A TRANSITION PROVIDE
        A POINT TO POINT DESCRIPTION FROM THE TRANSITION FIX
        TO THE ENROUTE AIRSPACE SYSTEM.

      - THERE MAY BE MULTIPLE TRANSITION GROUPS FOR A DP. THEY
        WILL MAINTAIN THE SAME INTERNAL SEQUENCE NUMBER. PRESENCE
        OF DATA IN THE COMPUTER CODE FIELD SIGNALS THE BEGINNING OF
        A TRANSITION RECORD GROUP.

      - DESCRIPTION OF A DP IS COMPLETE WHEN A RECORD IS READ
        THAT CONTAINS A DIFFERENT INTERNAL SEQUENCE NUMBER (I.E.
        THE FIRST RECORD OF THE NEXT DP).
