FILE STRUCTURE DESCRIPTION  
--------------------------  
  
    THIS FILE CONTAINS ALL AIRPORTS THAT HAVE OR ARE PROVIDED  
    TERMINAL COMMUNICATIONS.  IT INCLUDES AIRPORTS WITH VISUAL  
    FLIGHT RULES(VFR) AND INSTRUMENT FLIGHT RULES(IFR) TOWERS, AND  
    AIRPORTS HAVING TERMINAL COMMUNICATIONS PROVIDED BY AIR ROUTE  
    TRAFFIC CONTROL CENTERS AND FLIGHT SERVICE STATIONS.  
  
    WHEN A TERMINAL COMMUNICATIONS FACILITY(MASTER AIRPORT) PROVIDES  
    SERVICES FOR A SATELLITE AIRPORT THE FREQUENCY/USE INFORMATION FOR  
    APPROACH/DEPARTURE CONTROL IS CONTAINED IN RECORD TWR7 AND THAT  
    RECORD IS WITH THE MASTER AIRPORT THAT PROVIDES THE SERVICE.  
  
    THE LOCATION IDENTIFIER IN RECORD TWR7 POINTS TO THE SAT-  
    TELLITE AIRPORT BEING PROVIDED APPROACH/DEPARTURE SERVICE.  
  
    THERE ARE A VARIABLE NUMBER OF FIXED LENGTH RECORDS FOR EACH  
    TERMINAL COMMUNICATIONS FACILITY.  THE NUMBER OF RECORDS IS  
    DETERMINED BY (1) OPERATING HOURS, (2) THE AMOUNT OF TEXT NEEDED  
    TO DESCRIBE THE COMMUNICATIONS FREQUENCIES AND THEIR USES,  
    (3) SERVICES PROVIDED TO SATELLITE AIRPORTS, (4) DIFFERENT TYPES  
    OF RADAR AIRPORTS, (5) THE AMOUNT OF TEXTUAL REMARKS PERTAINING TO  
    THE TERMINAL COMMUNICATION FACILITY, AND (6) THE NUMBER OF  
    SATELLITE AIRPORTS BEING PROVIDED SERVICE FROM A TERMINAL  
    COMMUNICATIONS FACILITY.  
  
    THE RECORDS ARE IDENTIFIED BY A RECORD TYPE INDICATOR (TWR1,  
    TWR2, TWR3, TWR4, TWR5, TWR6, TWR7, TWR8, TWR9) AND THE TERMINAL
    COMMUNICATIONS IDENTIFIER FACILITY.  
  
    EACH RECORD ENDS WITH A CARRIAGE RETURN CHARACTER AND LINE FEED 
    CHARACTER (CR/LF). THIS LINE TERMINATOR IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE 
    LOGICAL RECORD LENGTH.

    THE FILE IS SORTED BY: TERMINAL COMMUNICATIONS FACILITY IDENTIFIER  
  
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD TYPES  
-------------------------------  
 
        - A TWR1 RECORD CONTAINS THE TERMINAL COMMUNICATIONS FACILITY  
          GENERAL DESCRIPTIVE LOCATION AND OPERATION INFORMATION.  THE  
          PRIMARY KEY FOR THIS AND ALL OTHER RECORDS IS THE FOUR  
          CHARACTER ALPHANUMERIC LOCATION IDENTIFIER CODE.  (THERE IS  
          ALWAYS ONE TWR1 RECORD).  
  
        - THE TWR2 RECORD(S) CONTAIN(S) THE DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATING  
          HOURS OF THE FACILITY.  THERE CAN BE 0 OR 1 TWR2 RECORDS.  
  
        - THE TWR3 RECORD(S) CONTAIN(S) THE COMMUNICATIONS FREQUENCIES  
          AND THEIR USE.  TWR3 RECORD(S) MAY OR MAY NOT EXIST.  
  
        - THE TWR4 RECORD(S) DEFINE(S) THE TYPE OF SERVICE(S) PROVIDED  
          BY THE TERMINAL COMMUNICATIONS FACILITY(MASTER AIRPORT) TO A  
          SATELLITE AIRPORT AND THE SERVICES AVAILABLE AT THE TOWER.  
          TWR4 RECORD(S) MAY OR MY NOT EXIST.  
  
        - THE TWR5 RECORD(S) CONTAIN(S) INFORMATION ON EXISTENCE OF  
          RADAR AND THE TYPE OF RADAR AT THE FACILITY.  
          TWR5 RECORD(S) THERE MAY BE 0 OR 1 TWR5 RECORDS.  
  
        - THE TWR6 RECORD(S) CONTAIN(S) TEXTUAL REMARKS PERTAINING  
          TO TERMINAL COMMUNICATIONS FACILITY.  
          TWR6 RECORD(S) MAY OR MAY NOT EXIST.  
  
        - THE TWR7 RECORD(S) CONTAIN(S) GENERAL DESCRIPTIVE  
          LOCATION AND OPERATION INFORMATION FOR A SATELLITE  
          AIRPORT ASSOCIATED WITH THE TERMINAL COMMUNICATIONS FACILITY  
          (MASTER AIRPORT).  THERE IS ONE TWR7 RECORD FOR EACH FREQUENCY  
          AND USE SERVICED BY A MASTER AIRPORT.

        - THE TWR8 RECORD CONTAINS INFORMATION ON CLASS B/C/D/E AIRSPACE  
          AND AIRSPACE HOURS. TWR8 RECORD WILL REPORT ONLY IF ONE OR MORE
          AIRSPACE CLASSES HAVE 'Y' VALUE. NULL VALUES WILL REPORT AS BLANK.   
          THERE MAY BE 0 OR 1 TWR8 RECORDS.  

        - THE TWR9 RECORD CONTAINS ATIS DATA
          THERE MAY BE 1 OR MORE TWR9 RECORDS.
