INFORMATION EFFECTIVE DATE: 04/05/2012

    RECORD FORMAT: FIXED
    LOGICAL RECORD LENGTH: 124

FILE STRUCTURE DESCRIPTION:
    EACH RECORD REPRESENTS A NAVAID OR FIX THAT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A HIGH 
    ALTITUDE REDESIGN SIGNIFICANT POINT. THESE POINTS WILL BE DESIGNATED AS 
    EITHER A PITCH POINT, A CATCH POINT, AND/OR AN SUA/ATCAA WAYPOINT. THESE 
    RECORDS CONSIST OF FIELDS AS DESCRIBED IN THE FIELD DESCRIPTIONS LISTED 
    BELOW. RECORDS ARE SORTED IN ASCENDING ORDER BY FIELD FIX/NAVAID ID.

GENERAL INFORMATION:  
    1.  LEFT JUSTIFIED FIELDS HAVE TRAILING BLANKS  
    2.  EACH RECORD ENDS WITH A CARRIAGE RETURN CHARACTER AND LINE FEED 
        CHARACTER (CR/LF). THIS LINE TERMINATOR IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE 
        LOGICAL RECORD LENGTH.
    3.  NUMERIC COMPONENTS (DEGREES, MINUTES, AND SECONDS) OF LATITUDE AND
        LONGITUDE FIELDS ARE RIGHT JUSTIFIED WITH LEADING ZEROS.
