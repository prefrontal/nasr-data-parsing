INFORMATION EFFECTIVE DATE: 10/17/2013 CHARTING CYCLE

    RECORD FORMAT: FIXED
    LOGICAL RECORD LENGTH: 1529



FILE STRUCTURE DESCRIPTION:
---------------------------

    THERE ARE A VARIABLE NUMBER OF FIXED-LENGTH RECORDS FOR
    EACH LANDING FACILITY.  THE NUMBER OF RECORDS IS DETERMINED
    BY THE NUMBER OF RUNWAYS AND REMARKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FACILITY.
    THE RECORDS ARE IDENTIFIABLE BY A RECORD TYPE INDICATOR
    (APT, ATT, RWY, ARS, OR RMK), AND LANDING FACILITY SITE NUMBER.

    THE FILE IS SORTED BY STATE, SITE NUMBER (IMPLIES CITY AND
    STATE), AND RECORD TYPE (APT THEN ATT THEN RWY THEN ARS THEN RMK).
    RUNWAY RECORDS ARE FURTHER SORTED BY THE RUNWAY DESIGNATION.
    ARRESTING SYSTEM RECORDS ARE FURTHER SORTED BY THE RUNWAY
    DESIGNATION AND THE RUNWAY END DESIGNATION.
    REMARK RECORDS ARE FURTHER SORTED BY REMARK ELEMENT NAME.

    EACH RECORD ENDS WITH A CARRIAGE RETURN CHARACTER AND LINE FEED
    CHARACTER (CR/LF). THIS LINE TERMINATOR IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE
    LOGICAL RECORD LENGTH.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD TYPES:
--------------------------------

    'APT' RECORDS CONTAIN THE BASIC LANDING FACILITY INFORMATION.
    IT DESCRIBES LOCATION, OWNERSHIP, FACILITIES, SERVICES, AND
    ACTIVITIES INFORMATION RELATED TO THE LANDING FACILITY. THERE
    IS ALWAYS ONE 'APT' RECORD FOR A LANDING FACILITY.

    'ATT' RECORDS CONTAIN TEXT DESCRIBING THE AIRPORT ATTENDANCE SCHEDULE
    WHEN MINIMUM SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE.  EACH 'ATT' RECORD CONTAINS ONE
    SET OF MONTHS, DAYS, AND HOURS WHEN THE AIRPORT IS ATTENDED.
    THERE MAY BE NONE, ONE, OR MANY ATTENDANCE SCHEDULE RECORDS FOR
    A LANDING FACILITY.

    'RWY' RECORDS CONTAIN INFORMATION RELATED TO ONE RUNWAY AT THE
    LANDING FACILITY (AIRPORT SITE) IDENTIFIED IN THE PREVIOUS 'APT'
    RECORD.  ALL INFORMATION FOR A RUNWAY IS IN ONE 'RWY' RECORD.
    INFORMATION IS CATEGORIZED BY THAT WHICH APPLIES TO THE ENTIRE
    RUNWAY AND THAT WHICH APPLIES TO THE BASE AND RECIPROCAL ENDS
    OF THE RUNWAY. THERE IS ONE 'RWY' RECORD FOR EACH RUNWAY AT
    THE LANDING FACILITY. THERE WILL ALWAYS BE AT LEAST ONE 'RWY'
    RECORD FOR A LANDING FACILITY.

    'ARS' RECORDS CONTAIN INFORMATION RELATED TO ONE ARRESTING SYSTEM
    LOCATED AT A PARTICULAR RUNWAY END AT THE LANDING FACILITY IDENTIFIED
    IN THE PREVIOUS 'APT' RECORD.  THERE MAY BE NONE, ONE, OR MANY
    ARRESTING SYSTEM RECORDS FOR A LANDING FACILITY AND ANY OF ITS
    RUNWAYS.

    'RMK' RECORDS CONTAIN TEXTUAL REMARKS PERTAINING TO THE LANDING
    FACILITY OR ITS RUNWAYS. REMARKS CAN BE GENERAL IN NATURE OR
    RELATE TO SPECIFIC AIRPORT OR RUNWAY DATA ITEMS. EACH 'RMK'
    RECORD CONTAINS ONE TEXTUAL REMARK. THERE MAY BE NONE, ONE,
    OR MANY REMARK RECORDS FOR A LANDING FACILITY.

    5.  THE TERMS 'AIRPORT' AND 'LANDING FACILITY' ARE USED
        SYNONYMOUSLY IN THIS DOCUMENT.

    6.  LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE INFORMATION IS REPRESENTED IN
         TWO WAYS:

            LAT/LONG VALUES AND ARE REPRESENTED AS FOLLOWS:

            LATITUDE    DD-MM-SS.SSSSH
            LONGITUDE   DDD-MM-SS.SSSSH

            WHERE :     DD IS DEGREES
                        MM IS MINUTES
                        SS.SSSS IS SECONDS, AND TEN THOUSANDTHS OF SECONDS-
                        H IS DECLINATION

            EXAMPLE :   LAT-   39-06-51.0701N
                        LONG-  075-27-54.6601W

             ARE LAT/LONG VALUES CONVERTED TO ALL SECONDS AS FOLLOWS:

             LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE     SSSSSS.SSSSH
             WHERE :    SSSSSS.SSSS IS THE DEG/MIN/SEC CONVERTED
                                   TO ALL SECONDS
                        H IS THE DECLINATION

    7.  A LIMITED NUMBER OF NON-US LANDING FACILITIES ARE INCLUDED IN THIS
        FILE. SOME OF THESE, IN PARTICULAR THE CANADIAN FACILITIES, ARE
        INCLUDED TO FACILITATE CARTOGRAPHIC REQUIREMENTS IN BORDER REGIONS.
        THESE RECORDS ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO BE COMPLETE AND ARE NOT INCLUSIVE
        OF ALL CANADIAN FACILITIES. THIS FILE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED OFFICIAL
