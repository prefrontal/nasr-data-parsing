             AIR ROUTE TRAFFIC CONTROL CENTER FACILITIES
             AND COMMUNICATIONS DATA BASE RECORD LAYOUT
                              (AFF-FILE)

INFORMATION EFFECTIVE DATE: 04/05/2012
    RECORD FORMAT: FIXED
    LOGICAL RECORD LENGTH: 254
 FILE STRUCTURE DESCRIPTION:
---------------------------

       THERE ARE A VARIABLE NUMBER OF FIXED-LENGTH RECORDS FOR EACH
    AIR ROUTE TRAFFIC CONTROL CENTER FACILITY. THE AIR ROUTE TRAFFIC
    CONTROL CENTER FACILITY FILE (ARTCC) CONTAINS ALL REMOTE AIR/GROUND
    FACILITIES (RCAG), AIR ROUTE SURVEILLANCE RADARS (ARSR), SECONDARY
    RADARS (SECRA), AND CENTER RADAR APPROACH CONTROL FACILITIES
    (CERAP), UNDER U.S. AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY. THE FILE DOES NOT
    INCLUDE ANY FOREIGN FACILITIES AND/OR RADARS.

       THE NUMBER OF RECORDS IS DETERMINED BY:

    1) THE AMOUNT OF TEXTUAL REMARKS PERTAINING TO THE AIR ROUTE TRAFFIC
       CONTROL CENTER
    2) FREQUENCIES AND THEIR USES ASSOCIATED WITH EACH AIR ROUTE
       TRAFFIC CONTROL CENTER
    3) THE AMOUNT OF TEXTUAL REMARKS PERTAINING TO FREQUENCIES AND THEIR
       USES

       THE RECORDS ARE IDENTIFIED BY A RECORD TYPE INDICATOR (AFF1,
    AFF2, AFF3, AFF4), AND THE ARTCC CENTER IDENTIFIER, LOCATION, AND
    FACILITY TYPE.

       THE FILE IS SORTED BY CENTER IDENTIFIER,
                             LOCATION,
                             FACILITY TYPE,
                             RECORD TYPE,
                            (FREQUENCY,
                             ASSOCIATED AIRPORT IDENT) - AFF3 RECORDS ONLY

       EACH RECORD ENDS WITH A CARRIAGE RETURN CHARACTER AND LINE FEED
    CHARACTER (CR/LF). THIS LINE TERMINATOR IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE LOGICAL
    RECORD LENGTH.


DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD TYPES:
--------------------------------

    'AFF1' RECORDS CONTAIN GENERAL DESCRIPTIVE LOCATION INFORMATION

PERTAINING TO THE AIR ROUTE TRAFFIC CONTROL CENTER FACILITY. THERE
    IS ALWAYS ONE 'AFF1' RECORD.

    'AFF2' RECORD(S) CONTAIN(S) TEXTUAL REMARKS PERTAINING TO THE AIR
    ROUTE TRAFFIC CONTROL CENTER FACILITY. THERE CAN BE 0 TO 50 'AFF2'
    RECORDS.

    'AFF3' RECORD(S) CONTAIN(S) THE COMMUNICATIONS FREQUENCIES AND
    THEIR USES AS THEY ARE RELATED TO THE AIR ROUTE TRAFFIC CONTROL
    CENTER FACILITY. THERE CAN BE 0 TO 50 'AFF3' RECORDS.

    'AFF4' RECORD(S) CONTAIN(S) TEXTUAL REMARKS PERTAINING TO THE
    COMMUNICATIONS FREQUENCIES AND THEIR USE. THERE CAN BE 0 TO 50
    'AFF4' RECORDS.


GENERAL INFORMATION:
--------------------
     1.  LEFT JUSTIFIED FIELDS HAVE TRAILING BLANKS
     2.  RIGHT JUSTIFIED FIELDS HAVE LEADING BLANKS
     3.  ELEMENT NUMBER IS FOR INTERNAL REFERENCE ONLY
         AND NOT IN THE RECORD.
     4.  THE UNIQUE RECORD IDENTIFIER IS MADE UP OF THE CENTER
         IDENTIFIER, LOCATION, AND FACILITY TYPE.
     5.  LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE INFORMATION IS REPRESENTED IN
         TWO WAYS:
         A.  FORMATTED:
            ------------
            LATITUDE    DD-MM-SS.SSSH
            LONGITUDE   DDD-MM-SS.SSSH

            WHERE :     DD IS DEGREES
                        MM IS MINUTES
                        SS.SSS IS SECONDS
                        H IS DECLINATION

            EXAMPLE :   LAT-   39-06-51.070N
                        LONG-  075-27-54.660W

          B.  IN ALL SECONDS:
             -----------------
             LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE     SSSSSS.SSSH
             WHERE :    SSSSSS.SSS IS THE DEG/MIN/SEC CONVERTED
                                   TO ALL SECONDS
                        H IS THE DECLINATION

             EXAMPLE :  LAT-   140811.070N
                        LONG-  271674.660W
