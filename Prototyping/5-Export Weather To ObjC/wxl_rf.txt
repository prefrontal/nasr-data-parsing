FILE STRUCTURE DESCRIPTION:  
---------------------------  
  
    THERE ARE A VARIABLE NUMBER OF FIXED-LENGTH RECORDS FOR EACH  
    WEATHER REPORTING LOCATION. EACH LOCATION WILL HAVE AT LEAST ONE  
    RECORD DESCRIBING LOCATION INFORMATION AND AVAILABLE WEATHER  
    SERVICES. FOR THOSE WEATHER REPORTING LOCATIONS THAT ARE  
    WEATHER COLLECTIVES OR HAVE SPECIFIC AFFECTED AREAS, THERE WILL BE  
    CONTINUATION RECORDS - ONE FOR EACH COLLECTIVE OR AFFECTED AREA  
    WEATHER SERVICE.  
  
    THIS FILE FORMAT WAS ORIGINALLY BUILT TO SUPPORT THE FAA'S  
    FLIGHT SERVICE AUTOMATION SYSTEM (FSAS). OTHER USERS OF  
    WEATHER REPORTING LOCATION INFORMATION WILL USE  
    THIS FSAS-SPECIFIED FILE FORMAT.  
  
    THE FILE IS SORTED BY WEATHER REPORTING LOCATION IDENTIFIER  
    WITH CONTINUATION RECORDS FOR A LOCATION IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING.  
    THE CONTINUATION RECORDS ARE IN RANDOM ORDER.  
    
    EACH RECORD ENDS WITH A CARRIAGE RETURN CHARACTER AND LINE FEED 
    CHARACTER (CR/LF). THIS LINE TERMINATOR IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE 
    LOGICAL RECORD LENGTH.
